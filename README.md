## Introduction

This project uses a TensorFlow object detection model to identify objects in UAV images. Additionally, it extracts geolocation information from the image's EXIF data to assign geographic coordinates to the detected objects. 

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ayush4ise/uav-object-geolocation.git
    cd uav-object-geolocation
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Ensure you have ExifTool installed. You can download it from [here](https://exiftool.org/).

## Usage

1. Place your input image in the `data` directory as `input_image.jpg`.
2. Run the detection script:
    ```bash
    python src/main.py
    ```

## Demo

To see the project in action, you can run the provided Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook object_detection_demo.ipynb
```
